# Whitepaper

Badges is a privacy preserving distributed identity platform that plans on utilizing CouchDB, the 
decentralized-internet SDK by Lonero, Blake3 hashing, and a PoCP or Proof of Computation 
consensus algorithm. It is privacy-preserving and offers a unique proposition for traditional blockchains 
centered around consensus algorithms. This paper introduces the conceptual design for BitBadges in its 
second version and as its own blockchain platform and cryptocurrency. The aim is to introduce various 
researchers to distributed consensus through an identity-based platform, while still keeping its 
decentralized and privacy-preserving nature. The main distributed computing paradigm or architectural 
design is centered around Peer to Peer Client Server models and a Point to Point message model. Its 
distributed system is centered around a grid computing design based off of fault tolerance and 
censorship-resistance. It also implements lockstep and modular operations. BitBadges was first iterated 
as a NFT hashing/badge creation solution and has slowly transitioned to an alternative to ERC721 to its 
own blockchain. BitBadges will be interoperable with various sidechain integrations for badge issuing 
and identity measures. These are further intentional integrations to make BitBadges further 
decentralized. The aim is to create a new model for distributed identity centered around PoCP.
